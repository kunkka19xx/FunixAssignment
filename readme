Project Requirement

Complete the following tasks in the project:

Task 1:

Create a new Python program called “lastname_firstname_grade_the_exams.py.”
(Make sure your source code file is inside of the same folder as the data files you just downloaded.)

Task 2:

Next, you will need to analyze the data contained within the file you just opened to ensure that it is
in the correct format.
Each data file contains a series of student responses in the following format:

Task 3:

Next, you are going to write a program to grade the exams for a given section.
The exam was a 25-question, multiple-choice exam. Here is a string that represents the answer key:
answer_key = "B,A,D,D,C,B,D,A,C,C,D,B,A,B,A,C,B,D,A,C,A,A,B,D,D"./

Task 4:

Finally, have your program generate a “results” file that contains the detailed results
for each student in your class.

------
Your program should use this key to compute a score for each valid line of data. Scores can be computed as follows:

+4 points for every right answer
0 points for every skipped answer
-1 point for every incorrect answer
You will also want to compute the following statistics for the entire class:

The average score
The highest score
The lowest score
The range of scores (the highest minus the lowest)
The median value (Sort the grades in ascending order.
If the # of students is odd you can take the middle of all the grades
(i.e. [0, 50, 100]—the median is 50). If the # of students is even you can compute
the mean by averaging the middle two values (i.e. [0, 50, 60, 100]—the median is 55).
